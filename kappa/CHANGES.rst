Changelog
=========

0.6.0 (2016-08-03)
------------------

- Fix for the config file example. [Igor Serko]

  Github doesn't seem to support `sourcecode` blocks ... instead they're
  called `code`, see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#code


- S3 Event Source Status fix. [Igor Serko]

  The CLI expects to see `EventSourceArn` and `State` in the result from the `status` method in each event_source. This makes it work for the S3 event sources


- 4-space indentation fix. [Matteo Sessa]

- Add support for prefix/suffix filters on S3. [Matteo Sessa]

- Include environment at lambda function qualifier. [Matteo Sessa]

- Include datasources in distribution. [Matteo Sessa]

- Fix #73. [LaiQiang Ding]

- Cloudwatch: eliminate 'else' before return in _to_status. [James
  Cooper]

- Remove event_source.py - accidentally re-added when I rebased. [James
  Cooper]

- Add .gitignore to 'cron' sample. [James Cooper]

- Added 'cron' sample to demo CloudWatch events. [James Cooper]

- Add CloudWatchEventSource. [James Cooper]

- Test_role.py: use string.printable instead of lowercase (fixes Python
  3.x) [James Cooper]

- Role.py: only strip 'Role' from 'get_role' response if present (passes
  placebo tests) [James Cooper]

- Add unit tests for Role.delete. [James Cooper]

- Context.py: revert pep8 fix. [James Cooper]

- Context.py: pep8 - line too long. [James Cooper]

- Modify role.delete to no-op if role missing. [James Cooper]

  If "kappa delete" fails midway then re-running it will fail during
  role removal.

  This PR modifies `delete` to check if the role exists.  If it does not
  then we log a debug line and return early.

  I also consolidated various methods that were calling `get_role` so that
  error handling is consistent, and removed `_find_all_roles` as
  `get_role` is sufficient, and probably faster (particularly for accounts
  with many roles).
